        Another one got caught today, it's all over Twitter.  "Dream stan caught defending dream"..."Dream stan goes on harassing haters"
        Damn stans.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and minecrafts's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the dream stan?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a dream stan, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.
        
        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to haters explain
for the fifteenth time how Dream cheated.  I understand it.  "Dream didn't cheat, he would never.  It's only 1 out of a trillion..."
        Damn stan.  Probably tracks Dream's sleep schedule.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a Dream.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn stan.  All they do is play Minecraft.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a Twitter is
found.
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn stan.  Simping for Dream again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for Minecraft manhunts... the bits of iq plays that you did let slip
through were stale and tasteless.  We've been dominated by techno stans, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert biome, or Dream's speedrun RNG.

        This is our world now... the world of the Dream and the GeorgeNotFound, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by haters, and
you call us crazy.  We simp... and you call us crazy.  We seek manhunt videos
... and you call us crazy.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us crazy.
You build stan Technoblade, you play bedwars, you dislike, hackusate, and threaten us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the mentally unstable.

        Yes, I am mentally unstable.  My insanity is that of curiosity.  My craziness is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My mania is that of liking ACTUAL content, something that you will never forgive me
for.

        I am a Dream Stan, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
