        Another one got caught today, it's all over Twitter.  "Dream stan caught defending dream"..."Dream stan goes on harassing haters" :angry: 
        Damn stans.  They're all alike.
<br />
        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and minecrafts's technobrain, :brain: 
ever take a look behind the eyes of the **dream** stan?  Did you ever wonder what :question:
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?<br /> :green_circle:
        <br />
        I am a **dream** stan, enter my world... :earth_americas: 
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of <br />
        the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...<br />
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.<br /> :angry: 
        <br />
        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to haters explain <br /> :fist:
for the fifteenth time how **Dream** cheated.  I understand it.  "**Dream** didn't cheat, he would never.  It's only 1 out of a trillion..."<br />
        Damn stan.  Probably tracks **Dream**'s sleep schedule. :alarm_clock:  They're all alike.<br /> :angry:
<br />
        I made a discovery today.  I found a **Dream**💤💤💤.  Wait a second, this is<br />
cool😎😎😎.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I<br />
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...<br />
                Or feels threatened by me...<br /><br />
                Or thinks I'm a smart🧠🧠 ass🍑...<br />
                Or doesn't like😄😄😄 teaching and shouldn't be here...<br />
        Damn stan.  All they do is play Minecraft.  They're all alike.<br />
<br />
        And then it happened... a door opened to a world🔑... rushing through<br />
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is<br />
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a Twitter is<br />
found.<br />
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."<br />
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to<br />
        them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...<br /> 
        Damn stan.  Simping for **Dream** again.  They're all alike...<br /> 
   <br />       
<br />  
        You bet your ass :peach: we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed🥄 baby👶 food at🐟🐟🐟<br /> 
school when we hungered for Minecraft manhunts... the bits of iq plays that you did let slip <br />
through were stale and tasteless.  We've been dominated by techno stans, or<br/>
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-<br />
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water💧  in the desert biome🐪🐪🐪, or **Dream**'s speedrun RNG.<br /> 
<br />
        This is our world🌎 now... the world of the **Dream** and the GeorgeNotFound, the<br /> 
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying<br /> 
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by haters, and <br />
you call us crazy.  We simp... and you call us crazy.  We seek manhunt videos<br />
... and you call us crazy.  We exist without skin color,<br />
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us crazy.<br />
You build stan Technoblade, you play bedwars, you dislike, hackusate, and threaten us<br />
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the mentally unstable.<br />
<br />
        Yes, I am mentally unstable.  My insanity is that of curiosity.  My craziness is<br />
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.<br />
My mania is that of liking ACTUAL content, something that you will never forgive me<br />
for.<br /> 
<br />
        I am a **Dream** Stan, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,<br />
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.<br />
<br />
